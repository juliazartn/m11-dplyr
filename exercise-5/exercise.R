# Exercise 5: DPLYR Grouped Operations

# Install the nycflights13 package and read it in. Require the dplyr package.
#install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)
View(flights)

# In which month was the average departure delay the greatest?
# Hint: you'll have to perform a grouping operation before summarizing your data
month.delay <- group_by(flights, month) %>% summarise(mean = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% filter(mean == max(mean))

# If you create a data.frame with the columns "month", and "delay" above, you should be able to create 
# a scatterplot by passing it to the 'plot' function
plot(month.delay)

# In which airport were the average arrival delays the highest?
# Hint: you'll have to perform a grouping operation before summarizing your data
arr.delay.port <- group_by(flights, dest) %>% summarise(mean = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% arrange(desc(mean))

### Bonus ###
# Which city was flown to with the highest average speed?
city.by.speed <- mutate(flights, speed = distance/air_time *60) %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarise(avg_speed = mean(speed, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_speed))
